## Our Story

### The Beginning: 1976-1985

In 1976, when most commodity trading still happened on paper and via telex, **FTHTrading** opened its doors with a singular focus: **Brazilian coffee distribution to the US East Coast**.

Founder **[Founder Name]** recognized that specialty coffee — then a niche market — would define the next generation of café culture. While competitors chased volume in commercial-grade beans, FTHTrading built relationships with regenerative farms in Brazil's Cerrado region.

**Early Milestones:**
- **1976:** First shipment — 5,000 lbs Santos 17/18 to Philadelphia roasters
- **1978:** Established direct farm relationships in Minas Gerais
- **1982:** Expanded to Colombian coffee (Supremo, Excelso grades)
- **1985:** Brazil frost devastated crop → Multi-origin strategy saved clients

**Lesson:** Diversification isn't optional. It's survival.

### Expansion: 1985-2000

The 1985 Brazil frost triggered a strategic pivot. Clients asked: *"If you can source reliable coffee during a crisis, what else can you distribute?"*

**1982-1985: Precious Metals Entry**
- Client request led to first gold transaction ($120K allocated storage, Zurich)
- LBMA certification obtained
- Vault partnerships established (London, Zurich)

**1989-1995: Base Metals & Industrial Commodities**
- Copper, aluminum, nickel — servicing manufacturing clients
- LME integration for forward pricing
- First hedging strategies deployed

**1995-2000: Energy Products**
- Natural gas, crude oil, refined products
- Terminal logistics partnerships (Houston, Cushing)
- Futures market expertise developed

**Philosophy:** *"Follow the client's needs, not your comfort zone."*

### Digital Transformation: 2000-2015

**2008:** Financial crisis tested credit discipline → 0.8% bad debt rate (industry avg: 4.2%)  
**2010:** CRM adoption (Salesforce)  
**2012:** Sugar, cocoa, spices added (leverage existing agricultural infrastructure)  
**2015:** Mobile-first client portal
