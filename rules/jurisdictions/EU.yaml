compliance_automation_notes: |
  TradeComplianceAgent behavior:
  - EU deals → LOW flag (standard screening)
  - If commodity contains chemicals → MEDIUM flag (REACH compliance check required)
  - Flag message: "EU: Standard OFAC screening required. EU is low-risk. Check member state-specific regulations."
  - Recommendation: "Verify: (1) EORI number valid, (2) VAT treatment (import VAT vs. reverse charge), (3) UBO register consulted for EU legal entities, (4) REACH compliance if chemicals/hazardous materials."
  
  Note: This represents the EU as a whole. Individual member states (Germany, France, Netherlands, etc.) may have additional national requirements.
