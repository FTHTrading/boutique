  TradeComplianceAgent behavior:
  - Switzerland deals → LOW flag (standard screening)
  - If commodity is precious metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum) → MEDIUM flag (chain-of-custody verification required)
  - Flag message: "Switzerland: Standard OFAC screening required. If precious metals, verify LBMA refiner status and chain-of-custody."
  - Recommendation: "For precious metals: (1) Verify refiner is LBMA-approved, (2) Obtain assay certificate, (3) Document chain-of-custody per OECD Guidance, (4) Enhanced KYC on buyer/seller."
