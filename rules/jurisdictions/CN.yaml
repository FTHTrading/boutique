  TradeComplianceAgent behavior:
  - China deals → MEDIUM flag (standard sanctions screening)
  - If commodity is technology, AI, semiconductors, aerospace → HIGH flag (export control verification)
  - Flag message: "China: Targeted sanctions apply. Screen all parties against Entity List/MEU/SDN."
  - Recommendation: "Verify counterparty is not on BIS Entity List, MEU List, or OFAC SDN. Document screening results."
